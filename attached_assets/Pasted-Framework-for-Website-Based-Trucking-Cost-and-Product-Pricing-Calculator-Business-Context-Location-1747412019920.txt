Framework for Website-Based Trucking Cost and Product Pricing Calculator

Business Context

Locations:

Vicksburg, AZ (West of Phoenix)

Phoenix, AZ (Headquarters)

Congress/Park, AZ (North of Phoenix)

Products:

Compost, soils, dairy compost, worm castings, potting soils, soil amendments

Sold in truckloads: 24 tons or 90-120 cubic yards

Price range: $15/ton to $700/ton depending on product

Trucking cost: usually $500 and up per delivery

Goal
To build a website that:

Allows user to input their address.

Enables user to select the desired products (bulk, potting soil, soil amendments, etc.).

Automatically calculates:

Product cost based on type and quantity

Distance from nearest distribution site

Trucking cost

Total cost including delivery

Key Components Needed

User Input Module

Input fields for: Full address or zip code

Product selection dropdown or catalog (bulk, potting soil, worm castings, etc.)

Quantity selector (e.g., tons, cubic yards)

Distance Calculation

Use Google Maps API or Distance Matrix API

Determine distance from nearest shipping point (Vicksburg, Phoenix, Congress)

Calculate road miles, not straight-line distance

Trucking Cost Formula & Delivery Radius Framework

Base trucking rate: $500 for the first 50 miles

Per-mile rate: $3.00/mile after 50 miles

Max profitable delivery radius:

Up to 300 miles for most bulk loads

Beyond 300 miles, per-mile cost often exceeds value of lower-priced products

Products with higher margins (e.g., $300–$700/ton range) may justify delivery up to 500 miles

Cutoff threshold: No automated quotes beyond 500 miles; switch to manual quote request for custom freight

Example Costing:

100-mile delivery: $500 + (50 miles x $3) = $650

300-mile delivery: $500 + (250 miles x $3) = $1,250

500-mile delivery: $500 + (450 miles x $3) = $1,850

Product Selection & Base Pricing

Database of products with base price per ton or per cubic yard

Add product-specific delivery constraints if any

Quote Generator Logic

Nearest location finder logic

Fetch driving distance via API

Apply trucking formula

Apply product cost (multiplied by amount needed)

Sum to give user total estimate

Backend Technologies

Google Maps API / Distance Matrix API

Database (e.g., Firebase, PostgreSQL)

Framework: Node.js, Python Flask, or Next.js (preferred for frontend/backend integration)

Frontend Design

Clean UI with:

Input for address

Product selector with quantities

Quote/result panel showing breakdown of costs

Optional feature to save quote or email it

Future Enhancements

Add live trucking schedules or availability

Calculate emissions saved via bulk delivery

Apply volume discounts or delivery thresholds

Login feature to manage multiple quotes

Expand to more distribution points

Initial Deliverables Needed

List of all product types and base costs per unit

Delivery pricing table (base rate, mileage rate, regional surcharges)

Coordinates or zip codes of current delivery hubs

Truckload capacity rules for each product

Estimated margins or flexibility for quote rounding

This document will guide the setup of automated quote generation for the website based on user-selected products and entered address. It includes real distance-based delivery cost logic and delivery feasibility limits (300–500 miles) based on product profitability.
