**Project Description: SSWWholesale.com**

**Overview:**
SSWWholesale.com is a new website initiative by Soil Seed and Water designed specifically to showcase and facilitate bulk purchasing of soil and organic amendment products. The website will be public-facing, displaying all available products along with detailed information. While product browsing is open to everyone, bulk purchasing requires onboarding.

**Key Features:**
- Public catalog of all products with detailed descriptions and media
- Firebase-hosted images for clean, fast access
- Account creation and onboarding for bulk buyers
- Secure login for authenticated access to pricing/order portal

**Hosting Stack:**
- Firebase (Authentication, Hosting, Storage)
- React or other modern frontend framework

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Stage 1: Public Home Page Development**
1. Upload all product photos to Firebase Storage in `ssw/` folder.
2. Retrieve public URLs for each image.
3. Design a responsive home page to:
   - Display product name
   - Show product image (via public URL)
   - Brief description + link to full product page (if needed)
4. Ensure site does **not** require login to view product catalog.

**Stage 2: Onboarding for Bulk Buyers**
1. Create an onboarding form capturing:
   - Name, Company Name
   - Email, Phone
   - Shipping Address
   - Business Type
2. Store user data securely in Firestore.
3. Generate account access after submission.

**Stage 3: Account Creation & Authentication**
1. Enable Firebase Authentication (email/password)
2. Connect login/signup to onboarding flow
3. Redirect authenticated users to order dashboard

**Stage 4: Bulk Order Placement Portal**
1. Authenticated users can:
   - Browse product catalog with pricing
   - Add items to a quote/order
   - Submit order for review

**Firebase Configuration:**
```js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCU-VyuuD71KP-dhQOBjzit5WIQOVPBl_8",
  authDomain: "whysoilmatters-1c40b.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "whysoilmatters-1c40b",
  storageBucket: "whysoilmatters-1c40b.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "22444263895",
  appId: "1:22444263895:web:8f2f763809bcdb0bb26392",
  measurementId: "G-X8KF3FJZ61"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
```

Next steps: Once photos are uploaded to the `ssw/` folder in Storage, begin displaying them dynamically on the homepage layout.
