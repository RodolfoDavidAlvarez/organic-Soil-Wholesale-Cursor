      question: "What are the minimum order quantities for wholesale?",
      answer: "For wholesale, we require a minimum of a pallet of bags (50 units depending on size or quantity). This makes it easy for customers to calculate their orders and qualify for wholesale pricing."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer delivery services?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer delivery services within a 300-mile radius from Phoenix or Congress, Arizona. This is calculated based on our trucking service capabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the wholesale approval process take?",
      answer: "It takes about 1-2 business days to get approved. Then you'll be contacted and given directions on how to proceed."
    },
    {
      question: "Are your products certified organic?",
      answer: "Yes, all of our products at Soil Seed and Water are certified organic with OMRI, the U.S. Compost Council, and tested with certified labs. We maintain the highest standards for organic certification across our entire product line."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get custom blends for my specific growing needs?",
      answer: "Yes, we do offer custom services. This is opt-in and requires a little planning. Depending on the complexity, it could take some time. Please contact us to discuss your specific needs and place an order."
    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
      answer: "We accept credit cards, ACH, business checks, and cash. For our established partners, we offer net 30 and net 60 payment terms depending on quantity and order volume."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer seasonal discounts or promotions?",

    },
    {
      question: "How should I store your products?",
      answer: "For optimal quality, our products should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Bagged products should be kept off the ground and unopened until ready for use. Once opened, reseal the bag tightly or transfer to a sealed container to prevent moisture absorption."
    },
    {
      question: "What is your return policy?",
      answer: "We stand by the quality of our products. If you receive damaged or defective products, please contact the owner at the email provided in our footer. We're committed to resolving any quality issues promptly."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you ship internationally?",
      answer: "At this moment, we only ship within the United States. We are currently working on expanding our shipping capabilities. We reach nationwide through our partners at Amazon. Wholesale is only based on region or location. Contact our support team for more information."
